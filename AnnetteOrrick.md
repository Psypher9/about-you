I enjoy web design and development. I also enjoy spending time with friends and playing board/card games. 
I also love spending time outside and going on hikes. 
My least favorite candy is Butterfinger. 
I want to travel to Germany someday. 
My favorite joke: Everyone else may be sitting down, but I am outstanding.

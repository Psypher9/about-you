# Favorite joke
A Lutheran is hanging out at the zoo, enjoying all the animals, the lions,
tigers, and bears (oh my). He stops by the marine life exhibit, and he comes
to the otter enclosure. This particular zoo offers trays of fish for zoo
guests to feed the otters. He buys a tray, and waves a fish over the enclosure.
The otters pay him no mind. He throws one into the enclosure; an otter walks up,
sniffs it, and jumps into the water, ignoring the fish. He tries again; same
result.

Finally, he throws up his hands and says, "Here I stand. I can woo no otter."
